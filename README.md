## 🚀 What is NeXT?

NeXT is a lightweight, multi-language **blockchain** designed to help understand and demonstrate the core concepts of blockchain technology without the complexity of a full cryptocurrency.  
NXT symbolizes the **Next level** of blockchain development, integrating C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript, and Python — all working together as one.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Learning:** Understand how blocks, hashes, and transactions work.
- **Demonstration:** Showcase interoperability of multiple programming languages within one project.
- **Foundation:** Serve as a base for developing more advanced blockchain and crypto platforms.
- **Community:** Build a space for blockchain developers of all skill levels to collaborate.

---

## 🛜 Talk

- **Learning:** With people, family and friends.
- **Demonstration:** Show everything and create your own cryptocurrency, engines, etc. Due to this!
- **Foundation:** Create organizations from enthusiasts who are ready to use this blockchain to create something great and learn!
- **Community:** Chat in the official [NeXT ChaUP](https://github.com/B-HDtm/NeXT/discussions/1) chat and increase views of your projects, tell everyone, get and give support.

## ⚙️ How it works

- Each language generates random "transactions" — random amounts and hashes.
- A Python script coordinates execution, collecting outputs to simulate a blockchain log.
- The symbol `⥉` represents our chain connecting diverse technologies.

## NeXT> Test blockchain now

- New *NeXT token* **update**
- Now a **web terminal** is available where you can **check the blockchain in this repository without libraries and downloads**, just *start* and done!
- More information and a **list of commands in help** for information about **NeXT Online Terminal** write **ter**

- You can **check the blockchain** [*here*](https://nxt-token.pp.ua)

## 🛠 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/B-HDtm/NeXT
   cd NeXT
   ```

2. Ensure you have the required compilers and interpreters installed:
   - g++ (for C++)
   - Java JDK
   - PHP
   - Node.js
   - Python 3

3. Run the Python launcher to simulate the blockchain:

   ```bash
   python3 python_launcher.py
   ```

   You will see transactions generated by different languages output to the terminal.

## ✍️ How to Customize

- Replace random generators with actual cryptographic hash functions.
- Expand block and chain logic — consensus mechanisms, digital signatures, data persistence.
- Integrate peer-to-peer networking for decentralized operations.
- Connect databases to store the blockchain state and history.
- Build user interfaces — CLI tools or web dashboards.
